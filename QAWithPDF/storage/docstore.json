Machine learning, deep learning, and neural\r\nnetworks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually\r\na sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.\r\nThe way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm\r\nlearns. \"Deep\" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised\r\nlearning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily require a labeled dataset. The\r\ndeep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images),\r\nand it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different\r\ncategories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention\r\nrequired and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning\r\nas \"scalable machine learning\" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides\r\noutside ibm.com).\r\nClassical, or \"non-deep,\" machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to\r\nlearn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences\r\nbetween data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.\r\nNeural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers,\r\ncontaining an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or\r\nartificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold.

Based on some input data, which can be labeled or\r\nunlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.\r\nAn Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If\r\nthere are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess\r\nthe accuracy of the model.\r\nA Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the\r\ntraining set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the\r\nknown example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative\r\n\u201cevaluate and optimize\u201d process, updating weights autonomously until a\r\nthreshold of accuracy has been met.\r\nMachine learning methods\r\nMachine learning models fall into three primary categories.\r\nSupervised machine learning\r\nSupervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use\r\nof labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.\r\nAs input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted\r\nappropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the\r\nmodel avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a\r\nvariety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder\r\nfrom your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks,\r\nna\u00efve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector\r\nmachine (SVM).\r\nUnsupervised machine learning\r\nUnsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine\r\nlearning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters).\r\nThese algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for\r\nhuman intervention. This method\u2019s ability to discover similarities and differences in\r\ninformation make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies,\r\ncustomer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It\u2019s also used to reduce the\r\nnumber of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal\r\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common\r\napproaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural\r\nnetworks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.\r\nSemi-supervised learning\r\nSemi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and\r\nunsupervised learning.

This model learns\r\nas it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced\r\nto develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.\r\nThe IBM Watson\u00ae system that won the Jeopardy! challenge in 2011 is a good example.\r\nThe system used reinforcement learning to learn when to attempt an answer (or\r\nquestion, as it were), which square to select on the board, and how much to\r\nwager\u2014especially on daily doubles.\r\nLearn more about reinforcement learning\r\nCommon machine learning algorithms\r\nA number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used.

Neural networks are good at\r\nrecognizing patterns and play an important role in applications including natural\r\nlanguage translation, image recognition, speech recognition, and image creation.\r\nLinear regression: This algorithm is used to predict numerical values, based on a\r\nlinear relationship between different values. For example, the technique could be\r\nused to predict house prices based on historical data for the area.\r\nLogistic regression: This supervised learning algorithm makes predictions for\r\ncategorical response variables, such as \u201cyes/no\u201d answers to questions. It can be\r\nused for applications such as classifying spam and quality control on a\r\nproduction line.\r\nClustering: Using unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms can identify\r\npatterns in data so that it can be grouped. Computers can help data scientists by\r\nidentifying differences between data items that humans have overlooked.\r\nDecision trees: Decision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values\r\n(regression) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching\r\nsequence of linked decisions that can be represented with a tree diagram. One of\r\nthe advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and audit,\r\nunlike the black box of the neural network.\r\nRandom forests: In a random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a\r\nvalue or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees.\r\nAdvantages and disadvantages of machine learning algorithms\r\nDepending on your budget, need for speed and precision required, each algorithm\r\ntype\u2014supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement\u2014has its own\r\nadvantages and disadvantages. For example, decision tree algorithms are used for both\r\npredicting numerical values (regression problems) and classifying data into categories.\r\nDecision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that may be represented\r\nwith a tree diagram. A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to\r\nvalidate and audit than a neural network. The bad news is that they can be more\r\nunstable than other decision predictors.\r\nOverall, there are many advantages to machine learning that businesses can leverage\r\nfor new efficiencies. These include machine learning identifying patterns and trends in\r\nmassive volumes of data that humans might not spot at all.

To avoid wasting budget or displeasing customers,\r\norganizations should act on the answers only when there is high confidence in the\r\noutput.\r\nReal-world machine learning use cases\r\nHere are just a few examples of machine learning you might encounter every day:\r\nSpeech recognition: It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer\r\nspeech recognition, or speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses natural language\r\nprocessing (NLP) to translate human speech into a written format. Many mobile devices\r\nincorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search\u2014e.g. Siri\u2014or\r\nimprove accessibility for texting.\r\nCustomer service: Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer\r\njourney, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and\r\nsocial media platforms. Chatbots answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about\r\ntopics such as shipping, or provide personalized advice, cross-selling products or\r\nsuggesting sizes for users. Examples include virtual agents on e-commerce sites;\r\nmessaging bots, using Slack and Facebook Messenger; and tasks usually done by\r\nvirtual assistants and voice assistants.\r\nComputer vision: This AI technology enables computers to derive meaningful\r\ninformation from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and then take the\r\nappropriate action. Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has\r\napplications in photo tagging on social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and\r\nself-driving cars in the automotive industry.\r\nRecommendation engines: Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can\r\nhelp to discover data trends that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling\r\nstrategies. Recommendation engines are used by online retailers to make relevant\r\nproduct recommendations to customers during the checkout process.\r\nRobotic process automation (RPA): Also known as software robotics, RPA uses\r\nintelligent automation technologies to perform repetitive manual tasks.\r\nAutomated stock trading: Designed to optimize stock portfolios, AI-driven\r\nhigh-frequency trading platforms make thousands or even millions of trades per day\r\nwithout human intervention.\r\nFraud detection: Banks and other financial institutions can use machine learning to spot\r\nsuspicious transactions. Supervised learning can train a model using information about\r\nknown fraudulent transactions. Anomaly detection can identify transactions that look\r\natypical and deserve further investigation.\r\nChallenges of machine learning\r\nAs machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier.\r\nHowever, implementing machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of\r\nethical concerns about AI technologies. Some of these include:\r\nTechnological singularity\r\nWhile this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned\r\nwith the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological\r\nsingularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick\r\nBostrum defines superintelligence as \u201cany intellect that vastly outperforms the best\r\nhuman brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom,\r\nand social skills.\u201d Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the\r\nidea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous\r\nsystems, like self-driving cars. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never\r\nhave an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11491, "end_char_idx": 15543, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5850c721-3dfe-48cc-bea9-1b64cf52ec04": {"__data__": {"id_": "5850c721-3dfe-48cc-bea9-1b64cf52ec04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\QA System\\QAWithPDF\\Data\\ML.txt", "file_name": "ML.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-04-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fd97f9c9-f326-4598-ae3d-30751abdde87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\QA System\\QAWithPDF\\Data\\ML.txt", "file_name": "ML.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-04-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-10"}, "hash": "597eafdead0878dc8a46c999d1d28cc78fbc5cf9e7a384934635e817b8c700c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a076894-96b2-428b-9c37-15a4a72c9ef7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\QA System\\QAWithPDF\\Data\\ML.txt", "file_name": "ML.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2025-04-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-10"}, "hash": "124e00b9ab894e4e523d93f3501eb98492b67a48e9cf3a2ca0df81a05239ed17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cdaa7653-3baf-4072-8a41-4a8f092f3ce5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "210f49c4cfd5702a8f615da09a7c0d5b1eb1e5ecb924772eb3a72753985e7cc7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Should\r\nwe still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to\r\nsemi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this,\r\nbut these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI\r\ntechnology develops.\r\nAI impact on jobs\r\nWhile a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this\r\nconcern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see\r\nthat the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the\r\nautomotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric\r\nvehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn\u2019t going away,\r\nbut the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\r\nIn a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There\r\nwill need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people\r\nto address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be\r\naffected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with\r\nartificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition\r\nto new roles that are in demand.\r\nPrivacy\r\nPrivacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data\r\nsecurity. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent\r\nyears. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data\r\nof people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more\r\ncontrol of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing policies, such\r\nas the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and\r\nrequires businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation\r\nsuch as this has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally\r\nidentifiable information (PII). As a result, investments in security have become an\r\nincreasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and\r\nopportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.\r\nBias and discrimination\r\nInstances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have\r\nraised many ethical questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence. How can we\r\nsafeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be\r\ngenerated by biased human processes? While companies typically have good\r\nintentions for their automation efforts, Reuters (link resides outside ibm.com) highlights\r\nsome of the unforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices. In their\r\neffort to automate and simplify a process, Amazon unintentionally discriminated against\r\njob candidates by gender for technical roles, and the company ultimately had to scrap\r\nthe project. Harvard Business Review (link resides outside ibm.com) has raised other\r\npointed questions about the use of AI in hiring practices, such as what data you should\r\nbe able to use when evaluating a candidate for a role.\r\nBias and discrimination aren\u2019t limited to the human resources function either; they can\r\nbe found in a number of applications from facial recognition software to social media\r\nalgorithms.\r\nAs businesses become more aware of the risks with AI, they\u2019ve also become more\r\nactive in this discussion around AI ethics and values.

When reviewing multiple\r\nvendors to select an AI platform, there is often a tendency to think that more features =\r\na better system. Maybe so, but reviewers should start by thinking through what the AI\r\nplatform will be doing for their organization. What machine learning capabilities need to\r\nbe delivered and what features are important to accomplish them? One missing feature\r\nmight doom the usefulness of an entire system. Here are some features to consider.\r\nMLOps capabilities.

However, the script was revised numerous times over the course of some three decades of revivals and publications, and the phrase is present in some versions of the script, but not others.[178] The appearance of the line \"Elementary, my dear Potson\" in a Sherlock Holmes parody from 1901 has led some authors to speculate that, rather than this being an incidental formulation, the parodist drew upon an already well-established occurrences of \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\"[181][182]\r\n\r\nThe exact phrase, as well as close variants, can be seen in newspaper and journal articles as early as 1909.[178][183] It was also used by P. G. Wodehouse in his novel Psmith, Journalist, which was first serialised in The Captain magazine between October 1909 and February 1910; the phrase occurred in the January 1910 instalment. The phrase became familiar with the American public in part due to its use in the Rathbone-Bruce series of films from 1939 to 1946.[184]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Game\r\nMain article: Sherlockian game\r\nOverhead floor plan of Holmes's lodgings\r\nRuss Stutler's view of 221B Baker Street\r\nSherlock Holmes Museum, London\r\nCluttered desk with books, jars, sculpted elephants and other objects\r\nStudy\r\nCluttered room with fireplace, three armchairs and a violin\r\nDrawing room\r\nConan Doyle's 56 short stories and four novels are known as the \"canon\" by Holmes aficionados.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3353, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b36c61a-1972-4b9a-a3a4-f6a1f4ccc1a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b36c61a-1972-4b9a-a3a4-f6a1f4ccc1a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\QA System\\QAWithPDF\\Data\\Stochastic Processes.txt", "file_name": "Stochastic Processes.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5013, "creation_date": "2025-04-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7c3937b8-1e19-4c51-9a3c-7bfc51479d09", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\QA System\\QAWithPDF\\Data\\Stochastic Processes.txt", "file_name": "Stochastic Processes.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5013, "creation_date": "2025-04-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-10"}, "hash": "8198d135c1e3f9f131d0b3695e357f2251bf84ce4920142c0e2f4fa77225e00e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c066411e-7bd4-4a51-ae07-d288243daedb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\QA System\\QAWithPDF\\Data\\Stochastic Processes.txt", "file_name": "Stochastic Processes.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5013, "creation_date": "2025-04-10", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-10"}, "hash": "5c225434de7dc9321009875452ca9e4b4b6cee8906e8801145996e5cea80192a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Great Game (also known as the Holmesian Game, the Sherlockian Game, or simply the Game, also the Higher Criticism) applies the methods of literary and especially Biblical criticism to the canon, operating on the pretense that Holmes and Watson were real people and that Conan Doyle was not the author of the stories but Watson's literary agent. From this basis, it attempts to resolve or explain away contradictions in the canon\u2014such as the location of Watson's war wound, described as being in his shoulder in A Study in Scarlet and in his leg in The Sign of Four\u2014and clarify details about Holmes, Watson and their world, such as the exact dates of events in the stories, combining historical research with references from the stories to construct scholarly analyses.[185][186][187]\r\n\r\nFor example, one detail analyzed in the Game is Holmes's birth date. The chronology of the stories is notoriously difficult, with many stories lacking dates and many others containing contradictory ones. Christopher Morley and William Baring-Gould contend that the detective was born on 6 January 1854, the year being derived from the statement in \"His Last Bow\" that he was 60 years of age in 1914, while the precise day is derived from broader, non-canonical speculation.[188] This is the date the Baker Street Irregulars work from, with their annual dinner being held each January.[189][190] Laurie R. King instead argues that details in \"The Gloria Scott\" (a story with no precise internal date) indicate that Holmes finished his second (and final) year of university in 1880 or 1885.
